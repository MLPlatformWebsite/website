            The machine learning platform is part of the [Linaro Artificial
            Intelligence
            Initiative](https://www.linaro.org/news/linaro-announces-launch-of-machine-intelligence-initiative/)
            and is the home for Arm NN and Compute Library – open-source
            software libraries that optimise the execution of machine learning
            (ML) workloads on Arm-based processors.


            It enables a new era of advanced, ultra-efficient inference at the edge. Specifically designed for machine learning and

            neural network (NN) capabilities, the architecture is versatile enough to scale to any device, from the Internet of

            Things (IoT) to connected cars and servers.

            The machine learning platform libraries – Arm NN and Arm Compute
            Library – bridge the gap between existing neural network (NN)
            frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, Caffe and ONNX, and
            the underlying IP.


            They enable efficient translation of these NN frameworks, allowing them to run efficiently – without modification – across Arm Cortex-A CPUs, Arm Mali GPUs and the Arm ML processor.
