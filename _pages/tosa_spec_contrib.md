            # Specification Contributions
            The TOSA Specification is released under a different kind of licence to the software, one which enables vendors to create completely independent implementations of the TOSA specification which are not derivatives of anything on mlplatform.org.
            This license is posted at the start of the [TOSA specification](tosa_spec.html).
            To enable vendors to implement the TOSA Specification in this way, contributions need to be provided under a different license, the TOSA Specification Contributor Agreement.

            To view the TOSA Specification Contributor License Agreement, click below.

            ### How to Contribute
            Practically, contributions to the TOSA Specification are made by modifying the AsciiDoc markup of the specification.
            Those patches are then reviewed using GitHub on [https://github.com/arm/tosa-specification](https://github.com/arm/tosa-specification).
            However, before uploading Pull Requests for review, users must read and agree to the TOSA Specification Contributors License Agreement. This can be achieved by doing the following:

            - Read the TOSA CLA at [https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/tosa_cla.html](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/tosa_cla.html)
            - *If* you agree to these terms, send an e-mail stating your acceptance of the terms of the CLA to [tosa-cla@arm.com](mailto:tosa-cla@arm.com)
